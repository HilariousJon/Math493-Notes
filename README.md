# Math493-Notes

This repo contains my lecture notes and personal thoughts on the course Math493 25FA, basically it covers the contents of:
- Finite group theory
- Group representation theory

My course instructor is [Prof. Mircea Mustață](https://websites.umich.edu/~mmustata/).

If you spot any typos or if you have any suggestions, please open an issue, I am very happy to discuss any of it.
